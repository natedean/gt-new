    <h3>Keep Thinking</h3>
    <p>Learning and practicing music should be fun, not tedious or boring. You need to study music to be great, so make
      it fun, and your trip to greatness will seem short.</p>
    <p>GuitarThinker.com started as a blog, with articles about Guitar and Music Theory, later adding games. It soon
      became clear that the world has many guitar blogs, but few places to learn and practice music by playing games.
      Now GuitarThinker.com aims at providing the most compelling Guitar and Music Theory games on the internet, to help
      you grow as a musician and stay strong!</p>
